			<h3>SANTORINI</h3>
			   <div class="block">
			      <img src="images/evening.png" alt="pic">
			        <p class="text">The island is part of a group of islands that were borne from millions of years of volcanic activity and remains one of the most active volcanic areas of the Aegean. It was first inhabited by the Minoans in the Neolithic period and was named Strongoli, until a violent eruption in 1500 BC destroyed their town. Santorini was later known as Firá which came from its ancient name of Thira. The name was then changed to Kalliste, meaning “the beautiful one” before its modern name of Santorini was born in the 13th century, with the island being named after Saint Irene, after whom the oldest cathedral in Perissa was named.</p>

This beach is a truly wild beach, with no facilities such as toilets, restaurants or shops so make sure to pack a picnic and bring plenty of water.
